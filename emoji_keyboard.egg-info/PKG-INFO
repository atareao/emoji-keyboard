Description: # Emoji keyboard
        
        Virtual keyboard-like emoji picker for linux.
        
        This project uses artwork and data from the excellent [EmojiOne project](http://emojione.com/).
        
        ## Installation
        
        ### Dependencies
        
        You'll need Python 3 GObject bindings and python3-xlib package.
        If you're on a debian based distro you can install them with
        
        `sudo apt install python3-gi gir1.2-gtk-3.0 gir1.2-glib-2.0 python3-xlib`
        
        ### App
        
        There are several ways to install the app, you can install from deb you can
        find on [releases page](https://github.com/OzymandiasTheGreat/emoji-keyboard/releases).
        
        You can install with pip
        
        `sudo pip3 install https://github.com/OzymandiasTheGreat/emoji-keyboard/archive/master.zip`
        
        Or you can download the tarball, extract and run
        
        `sudo setup.py install`
        
        ## Usage
        
        Selecting `Show Keyboard` from the app indicator menu or, if your desktop
        environment supports it, middle-clicking app indicator will toggle the visibility
        of the picker. When the picker is visible simply clicking on emoji will type it
        into focused application.
        
        If you want to toggle the visibility of the picker with a hotkey, use your
        desktop environment's native hotkey utility to assign a hotkey to `emoji-keyboard`.
